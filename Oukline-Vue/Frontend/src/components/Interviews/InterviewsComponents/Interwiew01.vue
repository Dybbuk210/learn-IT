                    <InterviewQuestion>
                        We'd like to start by introducing you to our readers, your X account says you're a
                        Web Designer and Framer Developer. Was that always the case, or did you jump onto
                        this design and development path later?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                        <InterviewStrongText>Creativity has always been present in my life.</InterviewStrongText> It started with drawing when I was very young and quickly grew to a full-time obsession for me. That obsession and curiosity eventually led me to pursue other creative endeavors like design. I studied design and technology in college and after graduating I started building my own projects and social media presence. I eventually understood how important it is to learn different skills besides design and because of that, I joined the full-stack ideology of design, no-code, and creator economy.

                    <InterviewQuestion>
                        Is it difficult for you as a designer and developer to fight your way through the
                        competition? How do you go about promoting your services and products?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                        Yes, building a business and brand is extremely difficult and time-consuming. The global market brings a lot of competition but simultaneously opens so many opportunities for creators who want to build a career by leveraging their skills. <InterviewStrongText>For me, the secret is building a personal brand.</InterviewStrongText> The world is changing fast. Clients are searching for talent online, companies hire talent on social media platforms, and the way to stand out is by building this amazing asset called personal brand. Your brand, face, unique talents, personal views, and way of thinking are what sets you apart. To stand out online and leverage the digital gold rush, having a personal brand is a must.

                        You create professional templates in Framer, and we agreed with the team that they
                        look really good. Why did you choose framer as a designer? Did you consider
                        Webflow or Wordpress? After all, WordPress is the most used CMS in the world.
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                        For me Framer was my first choice because of the way it works. If you already have some experience with Figma, Framer will be so easy to work with. When I work with Framer I feel I'm working with a design tool and I love that! Besides, Framer continues to evolve daily and adds new features and options to help us designers build even more amazing stuff. New improvements with the CMS, plugins, and integrations make Framer a very attractive option for designers.

                        full-time job alongside your projects?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                       At the moment, building my design business is my full-time occupation. But, I'm not stopping there because I see myself as more than just a designer. <InterviewStrongText>My ultimate goal is to be a digital solopreneur with a portfolio of different digital businesses.</InterviewStrongText> Right now, I have two ventures going on: my web design and Framer dev services and my template shop. In the future, I will expand to different projects and ideas by adding new skills to my stack. I want to keep building my brand around my curiosity and keep building products online.

                    <InterviewQuestion>
                        What helped you in your beginnings? Did you watch youtube videos, follow Behance / Dribble
                        or reach for a design book?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                        At the beginning of my career, I watched countless hours of Figma, Photoshop, and Illustrator. These 3 were the first tools I stacked as a designer and I still use them a lot today (especially Figma ). But the most important thing is building things while you learn, so for me what helped me evolve fast was creating every day even when I didn't master the tool.<br>
                        By creating every day and sharing your journey on social media ( X, Behance, Dribbble ) you start building a portfolio of work to attract clients. <InterviewStrongText>Reading is also a big part of my journey. There is one book I recommend to everyone: it's called the almanack of Naval Ravikant. This book has nothing to do with design but it had the biggest impact on my journey so far.</InterviewStrongText>

                        what advice would you give them? Do you have any advice that will help or motivate them?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                        Yes I have. When I was just starting out a few years ago it was scary. I had zero knowledge of business, content creation, or social media. The only thing I had was a passion and obsession about learning design and becoming better at my craft. Because of that obsession.<br>
                        I understood how important it is to learn and share your work with the world. Follow your interests with everything you have, stack  different knowledge and learn the tools.<br>
                        <InterviewStrongText>Design is a very interesting field of work and if you really love it, you should pursue it.</InterviewStrongText><br>

                    <InterviewQuestion>
                        Times have come fast. Not long ago we were working without AI and today we have
                        Chat GPT, Microsoft Copilot and hundreds of new AI plugins in Figma and other tools
                        for designers and developers. Technology is moving at a meteoric pace.
                        Do you think designers and developers should prepare themselves to work in virtual/augmented
                        reality soon? Will clients soon require us to do special virtual reality design in addition to website design?
                    </InterviewQuestion>

                    <InterviewText>
                       Yes the world is changing fast and we must adapt even faster. With the rise of AI technology, a lot of things are going to change soon. With that, we must keep our minds open and keep learning daily. As a designer, I already use a lot of AI tools to help me with my work. Tools like ChatGPT, ClaudeAI, and midjourney are so valuable if we know how to use them. That is why I believe that the future belongs to creators who possess a wide range of skills and don't get stuck in a specific field. Learning skills like design, digital marketing, AI tools, content creation, community, communication, 3D & motion design, copywriting, and brand building  will be major keys in the future.

                        AI tools are very useful.

                    <InterviewText>
                       At the moment, my life is a little unbalanced. The reason is that I believe that to build and achieve great things in your career, you must make sacrifices and put in the necessary hours on your craft. I still find time to do things I enjoy a lot outside of work like reading, going to the gym, and doing digital art but the majority of my time is spent working and learning to become better.

                    <InterviewText>
                        Focus is so important if you want to succeed in this world. The only social media app that I use often is X. I don't use Instagram or TikTok, I wake up early to hit the gym and after the gym, I get straight into work.I don't have my phone near me and this routine helps me stay sharp and focused on my work. Listening to deep music or podcasts also helps me stay focused.
